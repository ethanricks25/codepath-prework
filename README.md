## App Brainstorming

1. YouVersion Bible App
    - Contains a variety of translation of the bible
    - Contains the bible in different languages
    - Allows user to bookmark and highlight pages and scriptures
2. YouTube
    - Users can put videos on watch later list so they won't forget about them
    - Youtube also has a pretty good recommendation system for new videos
3. FaceTime
    - Users can communicate with others with high video quality
    - Users can also turn off their video and mute their audio

### App Idea

I would like to create a bible app that is also organized by topics along with the individual books. Details such as what category of books that they are would also be included. Also, if users wanted to read up on the particular doctrine of a group of people, there would tabs/sections for that also. Lastly, if a community of people such as church wanted to see scriptural highlights or notes from other people in their community, they would be able to. Of course, admins in the group could promote specific users if they were verified ministers or leadership in real life, and their notes and bookmarks would be highlighted/starred.
